# Liver Segmentation using Computed Tomography scans 
Used BSUnet for the segmentation of liver in the CT scans. The BSU model is implemented in BSUnet.py . The notebooks contains the python scripts for training the models. Evaluation scripts are in the evaluate folder. 

BSUnetModified.py is a redundant model file and used for some training only .

#TODO 
Merge the BSUnetModified.py with BSUnet.py
